        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>Jai Sai Ram Documentation</strong> is a trusted name when it comes to vehicle registration and related legal documentation services in the Delhi-NCR region. We specialize in helping customers who have recently purchased new vehicles—be it a car, taxi, or two-wheeler—complete the official registration process with the <strong>Regional Transport Office (RTO)</strong> seamlessly.</p>

  <p>
    Our services are currently available across <strong>Delhi</strong> and select parts of <strong>Haryana</strong>, offering a fast, transparent, and hassle-free experience. From preparing the required paperwork to filing and following up with the RTO, our team ensures everything is handled with precision and care.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of our most popular offerings is our <strong>Fancy Number Booking</strong> service. Customers can choose a vehicle registration number that reflects their personality or brand, based on availability and RTO fee structures. The more unique the number, the higher the corresponding government fee—but we make the selection and payment process simple for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to new registrations, we also handle <strong>RC Transfers</strong> for pre-owned or second-hand vehicles. Whether you’re buying or selling a vehicle, we help ensure that ownership is legally transferred without any delays or hidden complications.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <strong>Jai Sai Ram Documentation</strong>, we believe in building lasting trust through professional service, accurate guidance, and dedicated customer support. Let us handle your vehicle documentation—so you can hit the road worry-free.
