        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>At <strong>Jai Sai Ram Documentation</strong>, we offer comprehensive and hassle-free vehicle documentation services to simplify your post-purchase vehicle responsibilities. Here's what we specialize in:</p>

        <div class="service-section">
            <h3>1. New Vehicle Registration (RTO Registration)</h3>
            <p>
            If you've recently bought a new car or two-wheeler, our team helps you complete the mandatory registration process with the <strong>Regional Transport Office (RTO)</strong>. We handle the paperwork, submission, and follow-ups to ensure your vehicle is legally registered and road-ready in Delhi or Haryana.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-section">
            <h3>2. Fancy / VIP Number Booking</h3>
            <p>
            Want your vehicle to stand out? We offer <strong>special number booking</strong> services that let you choose a unique or lucky vehicle number, such as repeating digits or custom sequences. Our team guides you through the availability check, government fee structures, and booking process — making it easy to get the number you love.
            </p>
            <p><em>Note: Fancy numbers are subject to availability and additional government charges.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-section">
            <h3>3. RC Transfer (Ownership Transfer)</h3>
            <p>
            Buying or selling a second-hand vehicle? We take care of the <strong>Registration Certificate (RC) transfer</strong> process. This ensures the legal ownership is shifted to the buyer’s name smoothly — preventing any legal or tax issues in the future.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-section">
            <h3>4. Assistance for Taxis and Commercial Vehicles</h3>

            We don’t just serve personal vehicle owners — our services extend to <strong>commercial vehicles and taxis</strong> as well. Whether it's registration or fancy number booking, we ensure compliance with RTO requirements for business use.
            </p>
